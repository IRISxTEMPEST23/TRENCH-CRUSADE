        <h2>The World of Trench Crusade</h2>
        <p>Trench Crusade is a dark fantasy tabletop wargame set in an alternate history where the First Crusade uncovered a demonic artifact in Jerusalem that opened the Gates of Hell in 1009 AD. For nearly a thousand years, humanity has been locked in an eternal holy war against the forces of Hell, with the battlefield dominated by trenches, brutal melee combat, and terrifying supernatural weapons.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "The angels did not come as saviors but as executioners. The saints did not bring mercy but judgment. And God... God was silent as the world burned."
            <br>- Last Testament of Patriarch Urban II
        </div>
        
        <p>This setting blends medieval crusades with World War I aesthetics, creating a unique "mud and blood" fantasy universe where the forces of Heaven and Hell openly wage war across the blasted landscapes of Earth, with humanity caught in between.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>The Failed Apocalypse</h2>
        <p>During the First Crusade in 1009 AD, the Knights Templar discovered secret vaults beneath Jerusalem containing an ancient demonic artifact. Corrupted by its power, they committed the "Act of Ultimate Heresy," opening the Gate of Hell on Earth. Jerusalem was destroyed in the cataclysm that followed, becoming a depraved pit where Hell and our mortal plane bled into one.</p>
        
        <p>For eight centuries, the Church has waged its crusade to take back the Holy City. The landscape has been utterly devastated, criss-crossed with thousands of miles of mud, trenches and craters. The crusade is now waged with armies wielding terrifying weaponry, and both sides conjure up supernatural beings of immense power. Despite this, the armies remain at a stalemate in this eternal Trench Crusade.</p>

        <h2>The Major Factions</h2>
        
        <div class="faction">
            <h3>The True Church</h3>
            <p>The militant arm of Christianity, waging endless crusade against Hell. Its warrior-priests lead armies of flagellants, templars, and peasant levies in the name of a silent God. The Church's forces include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paladins:</strong> Near-perfect warriors infused with holy blood who can enter Hell itself and return</li>
                <li><strong>Trench Pilgrims:</strong> Zealots who throw themselves against the enemy in suicidal assaults</li>
                <li><strong>Observers:</strong> Warrior monks who can hear the Voice of God and perceive past, present and future simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faction">
            <h3>The Heretic Legions</h3>
            <p>Approximately one-third of humanity has bent the knee to Hell. The Heretic Legions are raised from these damned souls, equipped with infernal weapons and armor that burn both body and soul. Notable elements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anointed:</strong> Warriors who have walked to the shores of the Lake of Eternal Flame, emerging with blackened, unhealing flesh but immense strength</li>
                <li><strong>Death Commandos:</strong> Elite assassins trained in Hell's Seventh Circle</li>
                <li><strong>Choristers:</strong> Suicide victims resurrected as severed heads that sing unholy hymns</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faction">
            <h3>The Iron Sultanate</h3>
            <p>When Hell's gates opened, the great Iron Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn manifested to protect the faithful Muslims. The Sultanate combines medieval Islamic culture with advanced alchemical sciences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Janissaries:</strong> Elite warriors enhanced by alchemical elixirs</li>
                <li><strong>Lions of Jabir:</strong> Artificially created lifeforms used as war beasts</li>
                <li><strong>Assassins:</strong> Mystic killers who can bend space and time</li>

    <section id="warfare">
        <h2>The Nature of War</h2>
        <p>After 900 years of constant conflict, warfare in Trench Crusade has evolved into a horrifying blend of medieval and modern elements with supernatural horrors:</p>
        
        <div class="two-column">
            <div>
                <h3>Trench Networks</h3>
                <p>Thousands of miles of fortified positions crisscross the No Man's Lands between factions. These are not temporary constructions but permanent features of the landscape, some centuries old.</p>
                
                <h3>Divine & Infernal Technology</h3>
                <p>The Church produces Orichalcum Steel armor that can withstand bullets, while Heretics wield weapons forged in Hell's Iron Pits. Massive artillery pieces like the 666-foot "Mouth of Hell" cannon pound enemy positions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Supernatural Combatants</h3>
                <p>Angels and demons clash above battlefields while below, half-mad saints and resurrected martyrs lead charges against demon-possessed war machines and plague knights.</p>
                
                <h3>Psychological Warfare</h3>
                <p>Heretic Choristers' unholy hymns drive men mad, while Church Observers use the Voice of God to command friend and foe alike.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>Key Locations</h2>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>New Antioch</h3>
            <p>The most important fortress-city in the world, New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges since its walls were completed in 1595. Its seventy-seven mighty towers are embedded with anchorites - metallic battle shrines with devoted monks entombed within them. The city is a melting pot of cultures from across Christendom, all united in their war against Hell.</p>
            <p>New Antioch is home to massive factories producing tanks and artillery, as well as techno-laboratories where the Church creates superhuman Communicants empowered by cloned flesh and blood of the Redeemer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>The Iron Wall</h3>
            <p>The great defensive work of the Sultanate, this massive wall protects the faithful Muslims from Heretic assaults. Guarded by Janissaries and armed with advanced alchemical artillery, the wall has held for centuries against Hell's onslaughts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Jerusalem (The Bleeding Sepulchre)</h3>
            <p>The original site where the Gates of Hell were opened, Jerusalem has become a massive necropolis where the earth itself bleeds. Both sides fight endlessly for control of its cursed holy sites, though none can approach the actual Gates without being driven mad or destroyed.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="notable-units">
        <h2>Notable Military Units</h2>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Paladins of the Church</h3>
            <p>There were originally twelve Paladins, though only nine remain after nearly a millennium of war. These towering warriors (some standing 17 feet tall in armor) are the greatest creations of the Mendelist Order, with near-perfect physiques and holiness that allows them to enter Hell itself on missions. Their armor is irreplaceable since the destruction of Jerusalem, leaving many pieces damaged beyond repair.</p>
            <p>Paladins are used only for the most critical missions - assassinating key demons, destroying infernal laboratories, or extracting intelligence from captured devils.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Heretic Death Commandos</h3>
            <p>Raised from childhood in the Seventh Circle of Hell, these elite assassins have their tongues ripped out upon completing training. They wield Tartarus Claws quenched in the River Styx and use stealth generators powered by innocent hearts to hide from the eyes of God.</p>
            <p>Most infamous are Cain, Barabbas and Hannan, who simultaneously assassinated the Supreme Pontiff, High Prophetess Aelia, and Holy Roman Emperor in 1894, throwing Church forces into disarray.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Lions of Jabir</h3>
            <p>Created through the alchemical process of takwin, these artificial lifeforms serve as war beasts for the Sultanate. Each is unique, often malformed and in constant pain from their unnatural origins. The Sultan maintains a personal pack of seventy-seven Lions that accompany him into battle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Shrine Anchorites</h3>
            <p>Massive (12-15 foot tall) metal war machines piloted by monks who endure constant torment from interior spikes and hooks. Anchorites serve as mobile shrines and engines of war for Trench Pilgrim processions, wielding massive adamantine Catherine Wheels to crush heretics.</p>

        <h2>Supernatural Threats</h2>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>The Black Grail</h3>
            <p>Beelzebub's most dreaded weapon, this plague transforms victims into metastatic vessels - their bodies dissolve into screaming, conscious sludge while their souls remain trapped. The Black Grail caused the Corpse Wars (1340-1353) which killed tens of millions.</p>
            <p>Some victims become Heralds of Beelzebub - grotesque winged insects made of bloated flesh, or worse, Plague Knights who willingly serve the Lord of Flies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="unit-type">
            <h3>Demonic War Machines</h3>
            <p>Hell's forges produce terrifying constructs like the Brazen Bull - massive bronze-clad beasts armed with artillery pieces too heavy for humans to lift. The Heretics also deploy possessed tanks and infernal artillery that fires living ammunition.</p>
